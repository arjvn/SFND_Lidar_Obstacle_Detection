# Sensor Fusion Self-Driving Car Course
This is the first project in the Udacity Sensor Fusion Nanodegree. It consists of solving the following problem:

- Pointcloud processing with the help of PLC functions
- Understanding and deploying an implementation of RANSAC for ground segmentation
- Understanding and deploying the KD tree structure for the purpose of Euclidean distance clustering for the identification of key elements on the road

## Local Installation

### Ubuntu

1. Clone this github repo:

   ```sh
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/udacity/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection.git
   ```

2.  Edit [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/udacity/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) as follows:

   ```cmake
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8 FATAL_ERROR)

   add_definitions(-std=c++14)

   set(CXX_FLAGS "-Wall")
   set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS, "${CXX_FLAGS}")

   project(playback)

   find_package(PCL 1.11 REQUIRED)

   include_directories(${PCL_INCLUDE_DIRS})
   link_directories(${PCL_LIBRARY_DIRS})
   add_definitions(${PCL_DEFINITIONS})
   list(REMOVE_ITEM PCL_LIBRARIES "vtkproj4")


   add_executable (environment src/environment.cpp src/render/render.cpp src/processPointClouds.cpp)
   target_link_libraries (environment ${PCL_LIBRARIES})
   ```

3. Execute the following commands in a terminal

   ```shell
   sudo apt install libpcl-dev
   cd ~/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ./environment
   ```

   This should install the latest version of PCL. You should be able to do all the classroom exercises and project with this setup.
